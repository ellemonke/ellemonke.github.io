    by Ellen Hsu, Alexis Sophie Kozak and Samita Limbu<br />
    
    <p>Our team looked at the overall impact of population and land use on the ecological footprint per region in a global data set. 
    We found correlations from HDI and GDP to overall eco footprint as well.</p>

    <h3>Hypothesis:</h3>    
    <p>If developed countries create a higher ecological footprint,<br />
    Then when HDI is 0.7 or higher, the ecological footprint would increase.</p>

    <h3>Null:</h3>
    <p>If level of development in a country has no effect on ecological footprint,<br />
    Then the ecological footprint would be random across countries.</p>
